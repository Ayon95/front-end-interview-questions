----------- What is unidirectional data flow in React? ---------

- state is passed to the view and child components
- the view is rendered based on the state that it receives
- the view is the visual representation of the application state
- actions in the view, e.g. button click, trigger state changes
- state changes only when actions happen in the view
    - the view can never directly update the state
- state gets updated and the updated state is passed to the view and child components

state -> view -> actions -> state

- data in React can flow in one direction, from parent to child
- props can only be passed down from parent to child components

- when a component's state is updated, only its children are affected by the change
    - React re-renders the component and all its children when that component's state or props change

----------- Props vs state -----------

- state is data that a component owns
    - the data is defined locally within the component
    - the component also owns function to update that state
- props are pieces of data that a component receives from its parent
    - props are passed down from a parent to its children
- a component cannot directly change the value of a prop
    - the only way is to use the state setter function defined in the parent

--------- What does it mean to lift state up? -----------

- it is a way to share state between sibling components
- sometimes multiple components at the same level in the component tree will require the same data
- the only way to pass that data to those components is to lift that data up to their common parent component
- this will also ensure that the child components remain in sync with the data that they rely on
    - whenever that data will change, the child components will be re-rendered with the updated data
- data cannot move up or sideways; it can only move down from parent to children

--------- Controlled vs uncontrolled components ---------

- they render form control elements, e.g. input, select, textarea
- in a controlled component, the form data lives in the component as its state and is managed by the component
- in an uncontrolled component, the form data is stored and managed by the form control elements internally
    - the uncontrolled component can access form data via refs

Controlled component
- in a controlled input, the input value is bound to the component's state
- the component controls the input value by passing into it the state value via props
- an onChange event handler is used to notify the component of an input change, and the component updates its state
    - the input receives the updated value via the 'value' prop
- the input will show whatever the value is for the state

Uncontrolled component
- an uncontrolled input is not bound to the component's state
- it stores and manages its own state internally
- the value of that input can be obtained by using a ref
    - the ref is used to access the underlying input DOM node and get its value

------------ What is a ref? -----------

- a ref is a way to access underlying DOM nodes or React elements
- every JSX element has a ref prop into which you can pass a ref
- this way, you can store a reference to that DOM node or React element
- it provides an escape hatch to reach out to the DOM and manipulate it directly
    - in React, you normally don't manipulate the DOM directly
    - you tell React what changes need to be made, React creates a virtual DOM accordingly, and then ReactDOM
    reaches out to the actual DOM and applies those changes
    - with refs, you are bypassing this process and getting a hold of the actual DOM

Use cases of refs
- setting focus on an input programmatically
- triggering certain animations

----------- Keys and their importance in rendering list items --------

- a key is a special prop that React uses to identify and keep track of individual list items
- a key value needs to be stable and unique
- a key acts as a unique identifier for a list item
- with the help of keys, React can keep track of any changes that may occur in a list
- Keys help React identify exactly which items have changed, are added, removed, or rearranged
    - this allows React to efficiently update and re-render the list to the DOM

- do not use the index as the value of the key prop
    - the index is not specific to an item; it only indicates the current position of the item in the list
    - indices will change if you remove an item or rearrange items in the list
    - as a result, keys of all the items will change, and React will re-render them even though their content didn't change at all
    - this is not efficient because we're having to recreate some DOM elements unnecessarily
    - If a component’s key changes, the component will be destroyed and re-created
