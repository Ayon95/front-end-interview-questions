----------- What is the CSS Box Model? ---------

- it's a model that the browser uses to represent an HTML element on the page
- everything on a web page can be viewed as a box
- the box model has four parts
    - content box; defines the content area
    - padding box; defines the area between the content and border
    - border box; sits between padding and margin; wraps content and padding
    - margin box; the outermost box; wraps content, padding, and border

--------- What does box-sizing do? ----------

- the box-sizing property controls how the total width and height of an element is calculated
- its default value is content-box
    - this means that, by default, the height and width properties only define the content area of an element (the size of the content box)
        - it doesn't take padding and border into account
        - e.g. if you set the width of an element to 100px, its content box will be 100px wide
            - any border or padding you add to it will be added to 100px
            - so the total width of the element will be more than 100px
    - if you set it to border-box, then any width and height you apply to an element will define the total area of an element
        - this allows you to use the alternative box model
        - it takes any border and padding into account
        - the border box will be used as the defined area
        - e.g. if you set the width of an element to 100px, then that will include any border and padding you add to it

--------- Block vs inline vs inline-block display --------

display
- specifies the display behavior of an element
- can be block, inline, or inline-block

block display
- a block element occupies the entire width of its parent
- causes a line break at the end
    - block elements are stacked on top of each other
- height and width are respected
- padding, border, and margin will push away surrounding elements
- flex, grid, list-item, and table display also produce block-level boxes
- e.g. h1, p, div

inline display
- occupies only the space that is needed by the element's content
- does not cause a line break
    - appear beside each other in the same line
- height and width are not applied
- vertical padding, border, and margin will not push away surrounding elements
- transforms don't work
- e.g. a, span, em, strong, before and after pseudo-elements have inline display by default

inline-block display
- it is like an inline box that adheres to the box model
- occupies only the space that is needed by the element's content
- does not cause a line break
- height and width are applied
- padding, border, and margin will push away surrounding elements
- can be transformed
- img elements are treated like inline-block elements
    - they flow inline like text, but they also have a width and height like block elements
- e.g. img, button

--------- Static vs relative vs absolute vs fixed positioning ----------

position
- sets how an element is positioned in a document

A positioned element
- an element whose positioning is anything other than static

Static positioning
- the default positioning of elements
- The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document

Relative positioning
- the element is positioned according to the normal flow
- however its position can be changed relative to its normal position based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left
- it will not affect the position of its surrounding elements

Absolute positioning
- the element is removed from the normal flow
- the element is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor based on the values of top, right, bottom, and left
    - note that the height of the positioned ancestor will collapse
- if there isn't any positioned ancestor then the element will be positioned relative to the initial containing block (the viewport)

Fixed positioning
- element is removed from the normal flow
- the element remains fixed in one position
- element is positioned relative to the initial containing block
unless one of its ancestors has a transform, filter, or perspective set to something other than none
