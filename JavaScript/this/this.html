    <h1 class="title">The 'this' keyword in JavaScript</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>
        the 'this' keyword refers to the object that the function belongs to
      </li>
      <li>it points to the object that the code is operating in</li>
      <li>
        its value depends on how the function is called and it is assigned when
        the function is called
      </li>
      <li>
        Arrow functions do not bind their own this, instead, they inherit the
        one from the parent scope, which is called "lexical scoping"
      </li>
    </ul>
