----------- What is the CSS Box Model? ---------

- it's a model that the browser uses to represent an HTML element on the page
- everything on a web page can be viewed as a box
- the box model has four parts
    - content box; defines the content area
    - padding box; defines the area between the content and border
    - border box; sits between padding and margin; wraps content and padding
    - margin box; the outermost box; wraps content, padding, and border

--------- What does box-sizing do? ----------

- the box-sizing property controls how the total width and height of an element is calculated
- its default value is content-box
    - this means that, by default, the height and width properties only define the content area of an element (the size of the content box)
        - it doesn't take padding and border into account
        - e.g. if you set the width of an element to 100px, its content box will be 100px wide
            - any border or padding you add to it will be added to 100px
            - so the total width of the element will be more than 100px
    - if you set it to border-box, then any width and height you apply to an element will define the total area of an element
        - this allows you to use the alternative box model
        - it takes any border and padding into account
        - the border box will be used as the defined area
        - e.g. if you set the width of an element to 100px, then that will include any border and padding you add to it
