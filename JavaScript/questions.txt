--------- What data types are present in JavaScript? ----------

Primitive data types
- string
- number
- boolean
- undefined
- null
- Bigint

Non-primitive data type
- Object (any data type that is not primitive is of Object type)

--------- What is hoisting? ---------

- hoisting is the process by which var variables, class declarations, and function declarations
are seemingly moved to the top of the current scope
- as a result, they can be referenced or used before they are declared
- var variables can be used before declaring and assigning them a value but they will be undefined
    - only variable declarations are hoisted; not initializations

------- What is the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)? ---------

- it is the region in the scope in which variables are not fully initialized
- it starts from the beginning of the scope until the line of code where a variable is initialized with a value
- accessing let and const variables in the TDZ will result in an error
- var variables are undefined in the TDZ

--------- Strict equality (===) vs Loose equality (==) ---------

Strict equality
- strict equality operator compares both value and type
- no type coercion is done
- two operands are equal only if they have the same type and value

Loose equality
- loose equality operator only compares values
- if two operands have different types, then JS will try to convert them to the same type and then compare them

--------- What is implicit type coercion? ----------

- Implicit type coercion refers to how JS automatically converts a value from one data type to another in certain cases

String coercion
- when a number is added to a string, the number gets converted to a string

Number coercion
- when a string is subtracted from a number, the string gets converted to a number
- also when strings are compared (<,>), JS tries to convert them to numbers

Boolean coercion
- Boolean coercion takes place when using logical operators, ternary operators, if statements and loop checks
- truthy values get converted to true
- falsy values get converted to false

Equality coercion
- JS will try to convert operands to the same type when using loose-equality operator (==)

-------- Pass by value vs Pass by reference ---------

Pass by value
- when primitive data types are passed to a variable, they are passed by value
- when a primitive data type is passed to a variable, a new memory space is allocated for the value

Pass by reference
- non-primitive data types are passed by reference
- the reference to the object is directly passed to the new variable
- no new memory spot is allocated

-------- Higher order functions ---------

- these are functions that take other functions as arguments and/or return other functions
- this is possible because functions are first-class citizens in JS
    - functions can be stored in variables, passed to other functions, or returned from other functions
e.g. map, filter, reduce, etc.

---------- What is 'this' keyword? ---------

- the 'this' keyword refers to the object that the function belongs to
- it points to the object that the code is operating in
- its value depends on how the function is called and it is assigned when the function is called

- Arrow functions do not bind their own this, instead, they inherit the one from the parent scope, which is called "lexical scoping"

--------- Scope and Scope chain -----------

Scope
- the region in which a variable or function is declared and can be accessed

Global scope
- the top-level region in the code; the global namespace
- outside of any function or block

Function (local) scope
- the region inside of a function
- var variables are function-scoped

Block scope
- the region inside of any block {}
- let and const variables are block-scoped
- functions in ES6 (with strict mode) are also block-scoped

Scope chain and variable lookup
- all the scopes form a scope chain
- the global scope is at the top of the scope chain
- JS uses the scope chain to look up a variable when it is not present in a scope
- an outer scope cannot access a variable in an inner scope

---------- What is a Closure? ----------

- a closure is a function together with a reference to variables defined in the function's parent scope
- a function remembers the variables that are declared in its outer scope even after the parent function has finished being executed
- a closure gives you access to an outer functionâ€™s scope from an inner function
- it keeps a reference to its outer scope
- whenever you define a function, it forms a closure

-------- Explain prototypal inheritance ----------

- inheritance based on prototypes
- everything is an object in JS and all objects inherit properties and methods from their prototype
- when an instance of an object is created, a link to its prototype is established
- the Object prototype is at the top of the prototype chain
- every object in JS inherits properties from the Object prototype
- A prototype is a blueprint of an object
- an object is linked to its prototype via its .__proto__ property
- e.g. a Date object inherits properties from the Date prototype

Looking up in the prototype chain
- If the property or method is not present on the current object, JS will always try to look in its prototype
- if it still does not exist there, it looks inside the prototype's prototype and so on.

Benefits of prototypal inheritance
- reusability
    - many objects can inherit and use properties defined in a prototype
- memory efficiency
    - instead of defining the same properties for each object, the properties have to be defined once only in the prototype
        - this avoids creating numerous copies of the same properties

--------- Promise ---------

- promises are used to handle asynchronous logic
- a promise represents the eventual completion of an asynchronous task
- it is like a container that will eventually contain the outcome of an async task
- a promise lifecycle has two stages - pending, settled
- a settled promise can be either fulfilled or rejected

Pending state
- initially the promise is in pending state
- this is when the async task is running in the background

Fulfilled state
- a promise becomes fulfilled when the async task finishes successfully
- the promise is said to have a fulfillment value

Rejected state
- a promise is rejected when the async task fails
- the promise is said to be rejected with a rejection reason (the error that occurred)

--------- Async/await ---------

- async/await syntax allows us to write async logic in a much more elegant way than promise .then()
- it is still promise-based; syntactic sugar
- it allows us to write async logic in a synchronous way
- execution within the async function stops when an await expression is reached
- execution continues when the await expression returns a value
- you have to specify the 'async' keyword to declare an async function or use an async function expression 

await
- the await expression consists of the 'await' keyword and an async function, e.g. fetch
- the await expression returns the resolved value of the promise returned by the async function
- if the async function returns a rejected promise, then the await expression throws the error
