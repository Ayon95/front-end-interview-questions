--------- What data types are present in JavaScript? ----------

Primitive data types
- string
- number
- boolean
- undefined
- null
- Bigint

Non-primitive data type
- Object (any data type that is not primitive is of Object type)

--------- What is hoisting? ---------

- hoisting is the process by which var variables, class declarations, and function declarations
are seemingly moved to the top of the current scope
- as a result, they can be referenced or used before they are declared
- var variables can be used before declaring and assigning them a value but they will be undefined
    - only variable declarations are hoisted; not initializations

------- What is the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ)? ---------

- it is the region in the scope in which variables are not fully initialized
- it starts from the beginning of the scope until the line of code where a variable is initialized with a value
- accessing let and const variables in the TDZ will result in an error
- var variables are undefined in the TDZ
